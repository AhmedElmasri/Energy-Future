🌍 Predicting the Clean Energy Future: Strategic Modeling for Renewable Transformation

📘 Project Overview

This project presents a robust, data-driven exploration of renewable energy as the backbone of future energy systems. Leveraging hourly electricity generation and consumption data from 2018 to 2023, the study combines machine learning, statistical modeling, and compelling visual storytelling to advocate for renewable investment and policy reform.

🎯 Objectives

•  Demonstrate that renewable energy is a permanent, reliable, and sustainable power source.
•  Quantify renewable energy’s growing contribution and year-round availability.
•  Develop a composite metric, renewable_strength_score, to measure renewable performance.
•  Apply and validate predictive models to forecast renewable energy trends.
•  Empower data-driven decisions for investors, policymakers, and energy stakeholders.

🧩 Key Features

•  Rich Dataset: Cleaned and enriched hourly electricity generation data across all major renewable and nonrenewable   sources.
•  Custom Target Variable: renewable_strength_score — a strategic metric derived from:
   o  Total renewable generation (MWh)
   o  Share of renewables in the total energy mix
   o  Inverted electricity price (TRY/MWh)
•  Predictive Modeling:
   o  Linear Regression (R² ≈ 1.00)
   o  Random Forest Regressor (R² ≈ 0.998)
•  Insightful Visualizations:
   o  Renewable vs. Nonrenewable time series
   o  Renewable source contribution by year
   o  Score distribution and performance bands
   o  Feature importance and model comparisons
