Energy Insights 2018–2023

🔍 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of electricity generation, consumption, and pricing in Turkey from January 2018 to December 2023. The project uses hourly data across 20+ energy sources, with the goal of uncovering usage patterns, evaluating source dependencies, analyzing price dynamics, and informing sustainable energy planning.

📊 Objectives
- Analyze trends in electricity consumption and generation
- Examine shifts in the energy mix (renewable vs. fossil fuels)
- Investigate the balance between demand and generation
- Identify drivers of electricity pricing (TRY, USD, EUR)
- Build regression and clustering models for insight discovery

🛠️ Methodology
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: heatmaps, boxplots, source breakdowns
- **Regression Models**: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest
- **Clustering Analysis**: K-Means to classify energy usage profiles

📁 Structure
- Data: Cleaned and processed dataset
- Notebook: Colab notebook for EDA and modeling
- Reports: Visual summaries and analytical findings
- Dashboard: Streamlit Website 

📌 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab
- Streamlit for dashboard visualization

📈 Key Insights (Examples)
